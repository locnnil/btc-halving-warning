# BTC Halving Warning in your Browser Tab

This project consists of a BTC halving warning that displays how many blocks 
are left until the next halving.

The Bitcoin Halving is an event that occurs approximately every 4 years 
(or every 210,000 blocks to be more precise), during which the reward offered 
for a mined block is halved.
